# Animal Crossing New Horizons - Cooking Maximizer
Calculates what you should cook, based on the ingredients in your storage.

Currently it only has recipes/ingredients I have personally unlocked.
Feel free to open a pull request to add more recipes.

## How to use
1. Install requirements
2. Update storage.csv with your own items
3. Run acnh.py

## Native fruit
This script assumes your native fruit is peaches (mine are). 
If you have a different one, make sure to update the prices of the fruits in recipes.csv

## Intermediate products
If you want to keep (not sell) intermediate products (sugar, flour, etc) after cooking, and still want the nice profit overview,
set the prices for these items to 0 in recipes.csv
